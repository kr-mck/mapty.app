# mapty.app
Mapty.app is a small project built during Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course, but the improvements committed to this repo were created entirely by me.
I created the improvements to practise my JavaScript skills. 
Mapty is a small web application where You can add and store some informations about your sport activities (running and cycling).
