# mapty.app

Mapty.app is a small project built during Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course, but the improvements committed to this repo were created entirely by me.
I added some small enhancements to practise my JavaScript skills.
Mapty is a small web application where You can add and store some informations about your sport activities (running and cycling).

You can use it here: https://km-mapty.netlify.app/
